## [Project Euler \#1: Multiples of $3$ and $5$](https://www.hackerrank.com/contests/projecteuler/challenges/euler001/problem)

If we list all the natural numbers below $10$ that are multiples of $3$ or $5$, we get $3$, $5$, $6$ and $9$. The sum of these multiples is $23$.

Find the sum of all the multiples of $3$ or $5$ below $N$.

__Input__

First line contains $T$ that denotes the number of test cases. This is followed by $T$ lines, each containing an integer, $N$.

__Constraints__

$1 \leqslant T \leqslant 10^5$

__Output__

For each test case, print an integer that denotes the sum of all the multiples of $3$ or $5$ below $N$.
